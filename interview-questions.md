1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash is Rubys version of an array, a unqiue collection of data but unlike an array and it having indexs, hashes have key value pairs.

Researched answer: Hashes are data structures in Ruby that store data in unique key: value pairs. Unlike an array where you access the value through a numerical index, hash values have to be accessed through that specific key you are wanting to access. Hashes are contained in curly brackets and can be iterated over. I have used hashes in challenges where created a hash full of phone apps and we added and deleted them just to familiarize ourselves with hashes.
