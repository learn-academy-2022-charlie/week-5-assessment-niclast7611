# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash is Rubys version of an array, a unqiue collection of data but unlike an array and it having indexs, hashes have key value pairs.

Researched answer: Hashes are data structures in Ruby that store data in unique key: value pairs. Unlike an array where you access the value through a numerical index, hash values have to be accessed through that specific key you are wanting to access. Hashes are contained in curly brackets and can be iterated over. I have used hashes in challenges where created a hash full of phone apps and we added and deleted them just to familiarize ourselves with hashes.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is a specific ruby framework that someone has created and can be added to your project making the devs life easier depending on what you need it for. It is opened source.

Researched answer: A ruby gem is a package manager that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and librarys. Its a self contained bundle of code that you can download to your ruby file and it can perform certain tasks or abilitys to make life for a dev easier. I have used one breifly which was rails which is an entire web application framework that makes building websites and application quick and easy for the dev.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby on Rails is a gem that contains and entire web application framework that makes it super quick and easy for the dev to create small or large scale websites and applications.

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a gem that gives the dev a framework which provides structure for all the code they write. It helps devs build websites and applications easily and quick because it abstracts and simplifies repetitive tasks. Ruby and Rails were both designed to be in favor of the dev. I have brielfy used this gem in challenges familizarizing myself with the process of creating a rails application and server.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: Relational databases are basically excel spreadsheets for devs, they are divided into rows and columns for easy and organized storage of data.

Researched answer: Relational databases are a collection of data items that are organized by rows and columns in a table. This allows for easy readbility and storage of data. Kind of like Excel spreadsheet. Ruby uses Active Record as a relational database, an example of what a table would look like is if you have a person as a table the rows would be labeled creditcard, house, children, spouse, etc where we can fill in the values of if that person has that item and how many they have.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys contain a value kind of like an object or a Ruby hash where there are key:value pairs and to access the value you need to input the corresponding key. But instead the primary key is the column or row that the value we need to access is stored in.

Researched answer: A primary key is a column in a database that uniquley identifies the rows. It is unique and relational databases must always have one primary key. I have used primary keys when using relational databases like postgreSQL i label a column with the key that i want and when i need to assign a value or access the value I use the key name as the accessor to the value.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: is a route that provides mapping for HTTP verbs like get, post, put, and delete to control CRUD actions like create, read, update, and delete instead of relying soley on the URL to indiciate which site.

2. JSON: or JavaScript Object Notation is a standard text based format for representing structured data based on JS object syntax. Its commonly used for transmitting data in web applications

3. ERB: or Embedded RuBy is a feature of ruby that enables you to conveniently generate any kind of text in any quantity for templates. I believe it is also a gem.

4. Params: behave alot like ruby hashes they are methods that return ActionController::Parameters which gives access to form and URL query data.

5. API: or Aplication Programming Interface which allows applications to talk to each other
